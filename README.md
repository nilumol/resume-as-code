# My Resume (Markdown → PDF)

This repo contains my resume in Markdown format, with an automated workflow to generate a PDF version whenever I publish a new release.

## 📄 View My Resume
- [Markdown version](./resume.md)
- [PDF version (latest release)](https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/releases/latest)

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Resume is stored as `resume.md`
- GitHub Actions + md-to-pdf convert it to PDF
- Tagged releases attach the generated PDF automatically

## 🛠 Tech Used
- Markdown for easy editing
- md-to-pdf for document conversion
- GitHub Actions for automation
